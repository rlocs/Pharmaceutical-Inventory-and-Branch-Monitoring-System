# Pharmaceutical-Inventory-and-Branch-Monitoring-System
 The Pharmaceutical Inventory and Branch Monitoring System is designed to help pharmacies manage medicines and operations across multiple branches. It addresses common issues such as overstocking, shortages, and tracking expiry dates by providing a centralized platform for recording, updating, and monitoring inventories. 
 
This system introduces a centralized platform where pharmacy staff and administrators can record, update, and monitor medicine inventories. The system displays important details such as medicine price, expiry date, and stock availability, ensuring that staff can track supplies accurately and efficiently.
One of its key innovations is the integration of an Online Map API, which displays all branches on an interactive map. Beyond simply locating other branches (e.g., Mercury branch to another Mercury branch), the map allows users to search for specific medicines across branches. This means a branch can check if another location has a certain medicine in stock, view its availability in real time, and even recommend to customers the nearest branch carrying that product.

Additional (Integration) features include:

•	Automated Alerts: Notifications on dashboard for low-stock and near-expiry medicines to minimize shortages and reduce waste.

•	Branch-to-Branch Monitoring: Real-time visibility of inventories across all branches through the integrated map search.

•	Dashboard and Insights: A user-friendly dashboard showing best-selling medicines, sales summaries, and inventory trends for management.

•	Role-Based Access: Secure logins for administrators and staff to protect data integrity and assign clear responsibilities.

By combining inventory management with interactive branch-to-branch monitoring, this system enhances efficiency, coordination, and customer service. It empowers staff to make better decisions, helps management optimize resources, and ensures customers can quickly access essential medicines across branches.
